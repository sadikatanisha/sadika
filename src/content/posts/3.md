- **Visual Design**: Applied a modern, clean aesthetic using a muted color palette and intuitive navigation.

### Key Features

- **Interest-Based Matching**: Users can find and connect with others who share similar interests.
- **Personalized Profiles**: Customizable profiles to showcase your hobbies, interests, and more.
- **Share Thoughts**: Tell the app how you are feeling and be in control of your emotions.
